
This file describes 347 structural variants (SV) detected in tumor sample, with 30 columns. Most of the columns provide genome-focused details that might not be relevant to our analysis. But if we need to look more closely at specific variants, this file gives access to sequencing information such as type of SV, region of breakpoint and more.

Quick summary:

* Site1 / Site2 columns describe the two breakpoints of a Structural Variant (gene, region, position).
* Class, Breakpoint_Type, Connection_Type describe the type of SV.
* Event_Info, Annotation, Comments give biological context.
* Read counts help assess detection quality and confidence.

Detailed information for each column with examples can be found in this file.


Describes structural variants (SV) detected in tumor sample
Size: 347 x 30

Main Columns

- Sample_Id
Sample identifier (often includes patient, sample type, and internal code).
Example: P-0011192-T01-IM5

- SV_Status
Status of the structural variant: SOMATIC = present only in the tumor.
All values are set to SOMATIC for this file.

- Site1_Hugo_Symbol / Site2_Hugo_Symbol
Genes affected by the breakpoint or fusion.
Example: TERT, SDHAP3.

- Site1_Region / Site2_Region
Gene region of the breakpoint: Promoter, Intron, Exon, IGR (Intergenic Region).

- Site1_Region_Number / Site2_Region_Number
Exon or intron number, if applicable. Empty if not relevant (e.g., for IGR or Promoter).

- Site1_Chromosome / Site2_Chromosome
Chromosome of the breakpoint.

- Site1_Position / Site2_Position
Exact genomic coordinate of the breakpoint (according to the reference genome).

- Site1_Description / Site2_Description
More detailed description of the breakpoint location.
Example: Promoter of TERT(-): 280bp from tx start = 280 bases upstream of transcription start on the negative strand.

- Site2_Effect_On_Frame
Indicates whether the fusion/event causes a frameshift. Often empty if not applicable.
Three categories: in-frame, mid-exon, out of frame. 

- Class
Type of structural variant: DELETION, DUPLICATION, INVERSION, TRANSLOCATION

- NCBI_Build
Reference genome version: all are from GRCh37 

- Breakpoint_Type
PRECISE = exact breakpoint identified
IMPRECISE = approximate location

- Connection_Type
Orientation of the connection between breakpoints: 3to5, 5to5, 3to3.

- Event_Info
Short name or description of the event, e.g., TERT-SDHAP3 Fusion, Antisense Fusion, Deletion within transcript etc

- Annotation
More detailed genomic annotation, often including transcript IDs and exact positions. Some entries are empty for this one.

- Comments
Notes on the biological significance or predicted effect of the SV.

Support / Quantification Columns

- Normal_Read_Count
Number of reads in the normal, tumor-free sample covering the breakpoint.

- Normal_Variant_Count
Number of reads supporting the SV in the normal sample (often 0 for somatic variants).
Only values possible: 0 or 1.

- Tumor_Paired_End_Read_Count
Number of paired-end reads in the tumor supporting the SV.

- Tumor_Split_Read_Count
Number of split reads in the tumor supporting the SV (highly precise for breakpoint).

- SV_Length
Size of the variant in bases. For inversions or translocations, sometimes 0 if not defined.

- SV_VariantId
Internal ID for the SV.

- Tumor_Read_Count / Tumor_Variant_Count
Total reads and variant-supporting reads in the tumor sample.
